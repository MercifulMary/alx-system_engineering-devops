Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident
 
Issue Summary:
 
Duration:
Start Time: January 15, 2024, 10:30 AM (UTC)
End Time: January 15, 2024, 12:45 PM (UTC)
Impact:
The outage affected the user authentication service, leading to a complete downtime for approximately 20% of our users.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to reject legitimate user requests.
Timeline:
 
Detection:
The issue was detected at 10:30 AM through an influx of error alerts in the monitoring system specifically related to failed authentication requests.
Actions Taken:
Initial investigation focused on the authentication service logs to identify any code-level issues.
Assumed root cause to be a potential database connection problem.
Misleading paths included exploring recent code deployments, which turned out to be unrelated.
Escalation:
The incident was escalated to the DevOps and System Engineering teams at 11:00 AM as the scope of the issue became clearer.
Resolution:
The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancer settings to allow the expected volume of incoming authentication requests.
Load balancer configurations were reverted to a previous version known to be stable.
Root Cause and Resolution:
 
Root Cause:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to the rejection of legitimate user requests, causing the authentication service to fail.
Resolution:
The issue was resolved by identifying the specific misconfigured parameter in the load balancer settings and adjusting it to align with the expected traffic pattern.
Load balancer configurations were documented and reviewed to prevent a recurrence.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
 
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated checks for load balancer configurations during deployment to catch potential misconfigurations early.
Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more granular details about the nature of rejected requests.
Tasks:
Automated Configuration Checks:
Task: Develop and implement automated checks for load balancer configurations.
Subtask: Integrate configuration checks into the CI/CD pipeline.
Enhanced Monitoring Alerts:
Task: Enhance monitoring alerts for the authentication service.
Subtask: Include detailed information about rejected requests, highlighting potential misconfigurations.
Regular Configuration Reviews:
Task: Conduct regular reviews of critical system configurations, including load balancers.
Subtask: Document and share best practices for load balancer configuration.
This postmortem serves as a learning opportunity for the team, emphasizing the importance of thorough investigation and the implementation of preventive measures to ensure the stability of our web stack.
